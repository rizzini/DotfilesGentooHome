<h2>WebP file format plugin for Photoshop</h2>

<p>
<i>Copyright 2010-2013 Toby Thain, <a href="mailto:toby@telegraphics.com.au">toby@telegraphics.com.au</a></i>

<p>This plugin opens and saves 24-bit RGB
<a href="http://code.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP</a> files
using Google's libvpx library.

<p>Encoding and decoding have been successfully tested with Photoshop CS2,
CS3 and CS5 on OS X 10.5 and 10.6; and Photoshop 5 on Windows.

<h4>Current Limitations:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>No transparency/alpha channel (not yet defined for WebP).</li>
    <li>Windows version does not use .WEBP extension (at least in Photoshop 5).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Confused, or having trouble?</h3>

with bug reports, comments or suggestions.
